- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation processes.
- **models/**: Saved models.
- **app/**: Streamlit application files for deploying the real-time sentiment analysis web app.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Key Features

### Data Preprocessing

- **Cleaning:** Removing HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
- **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
- **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or root form.

### Feature Extraction

- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Converting text data into numerical vectors.
- **TF-IDF:** Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
- **Word2Vec:** Capturing semantic meaning of words by representing them as vectors.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **Algorithms Used:**
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

### Deployment

- **Streamlit App:** A user-friendly web application for real-time sentiment analysis.
- **Deployment Instructions:** Steps to deploy the app locally or on a cloud platform.
